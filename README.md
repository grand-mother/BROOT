# BROOT

BROOT is a browser for [ROOT files](https://root.cern/manual/io), format defined and used by CERN collaboration.

BROOT is an alternative to the [TBrowser tool](https://root.cern/manual/root_files/#root-object-browser)

BROOT doesn't use the ROOT library but the IO-specific [uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
